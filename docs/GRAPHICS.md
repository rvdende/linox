# Graphics

Linox shows its console and the Wayland desktop on one of two displays:

- the **UEFI GOP framebuffer** the firmware leaves behind (any PC, and QEMU's
  standard VGA), or
- a **virtio-gpu** in a virtual machine, driven by the kernel as a 2D
  display.

Either way, Linux programs see the same `/dev/fb0` (fbdev: `FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO`,
`FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO`, read/write, `MAP_SHARED` mmap), and the kernel console
draws on it until a domain maps it. The Rust compositor in `userland/`
composes in software and copies each frame into its mapping of `/dev/fb0`.

## virtio-gpu 2D driver

| Piece | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol | `crates/virtio-gpu` (`linox-virtio-gpu`) | Encodes `GET_DISPLAY_INFO`, `RESOURCE_CREATE_2D`, `RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING`, `SET_SCANOUT`, `TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D` and `RESOURCE_FLUSH`, checks replies, picks the mode, and packs damage rectangles into one atomic word. Pure, `no_std`, host-tested (`cargo test -p linox-virtio-gpu`). |
| Unsafe floor | `kernel/src/drivers/device_memory.rs` | `Mmio` (device registers in the kernel's uncached device window) and `DmaBuffer` (contiguous kernel frames from the frame allocator, reached through the direct map). Bounds-checked volatile access, no references to device-visible memory; the only `unsafe` the driver needs. |
| Transport | `kernel/src/drivers/virtio.rs` | Modern virtio 1.x over PCI, polled: capability parsing, reset, feature negotiation (`VERSION_1`, `ACCESS_PLATFORM`), and a split virtqueue used one batch of request/response chains at a time. Safe Rust. |
| Driver | `kernel/src/drivers/virtio_gpu.rs` | Discovery, bring-up, the scanout owner and the flush policy. Safe Rust apart from the owner's latch (`SCANOUT`, one `UnsafeCell` behind a try-only `AtomicBool`). |
| Hooks | `kernel/src/lib.rs`, `kernel/src/framebuffer.rs`, `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/timer.rs` | Device-window mapping and I/O MMU admission at boot; `framebuffer::adopt` moves the console and `/dev/fb0` to the GPU surface; the Linux timer tick calls `framebuffer::refresh`. |

### Bring-up

The driver follows the xHCI input driver's pattern:

1. **Discover** (before the kernel page tables): find `1af4:1050` on bus 0
   or behind its bridges, read its virtio capabilities, and require the
   common, notification and device structures in one memory BAR, within
   64 KiB. That span joins the device window (mapped uncached, no identity
   alias).
2. **Prepare** (DMA translation still off): reset, negotiate, set up the
   control queue (8 descriptors), `DRIVER_OK`, `GET_DISPLAY_INFO`, then
   allocate a surface for the first enabled scanout's mode (at most 8 MiB,
   e.g. 1920x1080; otherwise 1280x800) and run `RESOURCE_CREATE_2D`
   (`B8G8R8X8`, the same byte order as a BGRX GOP framebuffer) and
   `RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING` with a single entry, since the surface is
   physically contiguous.
3. **Admit**: the GPU's three DMA regions (ring, command page, surface) are
   admitted to the I/O MMU as standing devices in the same, single admission
   as the USB controllers, so the GPU keeps working while a volume or network
   translation is active. If both do not fit the standing table budget, USB
   is admitted alone and the GPU is reset.
4. **Activate**: `SET_SCANOUT`, then `framebuffer::adopt` re-lays out the
   console for the new size, keeps the text it already had (from a GOP
   console, if there was one), repaints, and flushes.

Without a virtio-gpu, or if any step fails, the firmware framebuffer stays
the display and the log says why.

### Flushing

A virtio-gpu surface is guest memory; the host shows only what the guest
flushes (`TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D` of a rectangle, then `RESOURCE_FLUSH`).

- **Kernel console and `write(2)` to `/dev/fb0`: on demand.** The console
  tracks the bounding box of the cells it drew during a write and hands it
  to the driver; `/dev/fb0` writes report the rows they touched. Damage
  accumulates in one `AtomicU64` (four 16-bit edges, merged with a CAS loop),
  so it can be added from any context. Whoever holds the GPU takes the damage
  and submits one transfer+flush batch without waiting for it. A console
  writer that finds an earlier batch still in flight waits up to 20 ms for
  it, so the last line written is never left unflushed.
- **A domain's `mmap` of `/dev/fb0`: periodic.** The kernel does not see
  those writes, so while a domain owns the screen the 1 kHz Linux timer tick
  flushes the whole surface at 60 Hz. The tick never waits: if a flush is
  still in flight it tries again on the next tick.

The GPU is behind a latch that is only ever *tried*: the console reaches it
from interrupt handlers and from code that holds ranked locks, so it must
never spin or take a ranked lock. A caller that finds the latch held leaves
its damage for the holder, which re-checks before returning, or for the next
tick. The device is polled; MSI-X stays off.

The periodic full-surface refresh costs the host a 4 MB copy per frame at
1280x800 whether or not anything changed. Linux's fbdev emulation instead
uses deferred I/O (write-protect the mapping, collect the pages that fault,
flush those after a delay); Linox could do the same with the dirty bits of
the domain's page-table entries, or let the compositor report damage.

### Running it

```sh
LINOX_QEMU_GPU=virtio tools/qemu/run.sh       # virtio-gpu-pci, no VGA
LINOX_QEMU_GPU=virtio-vga tools/qemu/run.sh   # GOP on the VGA part, then virtio-gpu
LINOX_QEMU_GPU_SIZE=1920x1080                 # the mode the host reports
make test-desktop-virtio-gpu                  # the Wayland desktop on virtio-gpu
```

`make test-desktop-virtio-gpu` runs `tests/qemu/wayland-desktop.sh` with no
VGA device at all and the host asking for 1024x768: OVMF's own virtio-gpu
GOP is blit-only, so there is no firmware framebuffer, and the screendump of
the virtio-gpu scanout shows the compositor and terminal only if the driver
became the display in the host's mode and flushed what the compositor wrote
through its mapping.

## 3D: Venus (Vulkan on the host GPU)

Linox runs unmodified Vulkan applications on the host's GPU through Mesa's
Venus driver, as a Linux guest does. With `LINOX_QEMU_GPU=venus`, run.sh
gives QEMU a `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` with `blob=on,venus=on`, a `hostmem`
region (default 4 GiB) and `ioeventfd=on`, on an EGL display
(`egl-headless`, or `gtk,gl=on` with `LINOX_QEMU_DISPLAY=gtk`). The host
needs virglrenderer built with Venus (QEMU 10.2 and virglrenderer 1.2 on
this machine).

| Piece | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3D commands | `crates/virtio-gpu` | Context, capset, blob (create, map, unmap), fenced `SUBMIT_3D` with a ring index, the shared-memory capability. |
| Device | `kernel/src/drivers/virtio_gpu.rs` | Negotiates `VIRGL`, `RESOURCE_BLOB` and `CONTEXT_INIT`, reads the capsets, places blobs in the host-visible region, keeps fenced submissions in flight (out-of-order completion), and reports a busy queue or fence as `EAGAIN` rather than spinning. |
| Render node | `crates/drm` (`linox-drm`), `kernel/src/linux_drm.rs` | `/dev/dri/renderD128` (226:128) with the virtgpu ioctls Mesa uses, sync-file fences, dma-buf export and import, and the sysfs entries libdrm's `drmGetDevices2` reads. An ioctl that must wait for the GPU lets the domain run and is issued again. |
| Mappings | `kernel/src/arch/x86_64/cpu/linux_devices.rs` (`linux_object_mmap`) | Blob pages are mapped with the caching the host gives in `RESOURCE_MAP_BLOB` (write-back, write-combining or uncached, through the page attribute table every CPU programs). A write-back mapping of memory the GPU writes without snooping never sees fence feedback change. |

Mesa presents through `wl_shm` (`MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw`), since linox-wm has
no linux-dmabuf yet: the Venus WSI copies each rendered frame into a shared
memory buffer, which the compositor draws straight from the client's pool.

### Measured (2026-11-01)

cadrs (Bevy, wgpu) in an Ubuntu 26.04 domain with one CPU, 1280x800, its
`camera_frame_walk` scenario, on the host's Radeon RX 6800 XT through Venus,
under linox-wm: after the first 100 frames (startup: a 5 s first frame and a
9 s scene load) mean 17.4 ms (57 fps), median 17 ms, p90 19 ms, worst 50 ms.
Before cheaper process switches (docs/SCHEDULER.md) the median was 23 ms
(p90 33 ms). Software rendering (lavapipe) on the same domain was 295 ms.
cadrs exits with SIGSEGV after its scenario (status 139). That is the
application and driver, not Linox: the main thread destroys the Vulkan
instance (the loader unloads `libvulkan_virtio.so`) and only then wakes a
thread that had used Venus; that thread exits, and glibc runs the
thread-specific-data destructor Venus registered with `pthread_key_create`
in the unloaded library. With the library kept loaded (`LD_PRELOAD`) the
same destructor dereferences the destroyed instance's ring instead. Multi-CPU
domains (`cpu=N`) are not yet usable with a compositor: a process whose
threads run on other CPUs cannot be switched out (docs/SCHEDULER.md).

```sh
LINOX_QEMU_GPU=venus tools/qemu/run.sh
# in the domain:
VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/virtio_icd.json MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw vulkaninfo --summary
```

Isolation is still per kernel: contexts and resources belong to the open
render node file, but the driver runs in the kernel rather than a ring-3
driver domain (decision 0002), and command streams go to the host as given.
