# Linux Test Project (LTP) Compatibility Harness

Linox's Linux compatibility is driven by the syscall tests of the
[Linux Test Project](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp) rather than by
chasing bugs one program at a time. This harness builds LTP statically for
musl, runs each test of `runtest/syscalls` in an Alpine domain on Linox under
QEMU, and reports one machine-parseable line per test plus failure clusters.

| `97c546ab` | ru_maxrss and SIGCHLD auto-reaping, Linux AIO per process, dnotify, CPU interval timers, interface ioctls, sched_setattr and SCHED_DEADLINE, stable directory cursors, many errno orders (4 CPUs, baseline 194; the one hang is fork14) | 1552 | 951 | 96 | 94 | 211 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| `468a6a67` | lazy large anonymous mappings (fork14 no longer hangs), memory locks and VmLck, real MREMAP_FIXED moves, wipe-on-fork in copy-on-write forks, domain flags write-execute and privileged (machine reboot, kernel log and syslog, chroot, process accounting, ptrace's core), /proc/config.gz (4 CPUs, baseline 154; the one hang is dirtyc0w_shmem) | 1552 | 987 | 72 | 78 | 213 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

\* Counted with the exit status alone, which overstated passes (below).
The later rows are rescored from each run's saved console logs with LTP's
own rule (`classify` in `tests/ltp/src/classify.rs`): a test that printed any
TBROK, TFAIL or TWARN counts as that, and TCONF only when nothing passed.
Each row ran with that commit's changes on top of its parent. The drop at
`18f44c93` is the shared result page starting to work: tests whose
failures were lost before now report them.

**Pass counts before 2026-11-01 were overstated by about 600.** The LTP
library counts results in a MAP_SHARED page of a /dev/shm file and derives
the test's exit status from it. Linox gave each process its own copy of
such a page, so results from the test process never reached the library's
process, which then exited 0: in the `778dd3d0` run 204 tests that
printed TFAIL and 416 that printed TBROK (60 of them an anonymous mmap
with fd 0 refused, about 60 "Test haven't reported results" or "bad magic"
from the lost page) were counted as passes. The harness now classifies by the printed results when
the exit status claims success, and shared mappings of a file now map the
file's own pages.

The `bdeb9c12` run no longer runs out of memory near its end (futex
and fork-heavy tests used to leave processes and ~380 MB behind, so every
exec after futex_cmp_requeue01 failed). Its extra hangs are tests that now
get further (futex_wait02/03, futex_wake03), and wait401 and waitpid10,
which pass alone but hung after killed processes outlived their tests;
killed processes now run first and die, and pause() sleeps properly
(after the run: signal01 passes, kill11 fails instead of breaking).

In the `e35668d6` run rename14 wedged the guest: with pause() sleeping
properly, its parent pauses for SIGALRM while two children rename in busy
loops, and nothing else got the CPU (not even LTP's own timeout). pause()
went back to returning EINTR after one yield (signal01 hangs again), and
init's killed-first pick is limited to sleeping processes and orphans init
adopted, since a running process with a live parent may be one a fork
transaction runs nested on the kernel stack. Both wait for the scheduler
loop.

A crash takes the whole domain down, so the run reboots for the next test:
the `de94acb9` run needed 23 boots against 68 before, the `76719aee` run 6,
and the `778dd3d0` run went through in one. The `7c6e1149` run's 16 hangs:
connect01 and fork14 stopped the guest reporting (the host watchdog
rebooted it); the rest are LTP's own 30-second timeouts with the guest
still alive: epoll_wait01/08/11/12/16, pselect01/_64, select02 and
select04 (select and epoll_pwait still return no events rather than
waiting for a signal), poll02, ppoll01, pause01, tgkill01 and
rt_tgsigqueueinfo01. Results of a
full run are kept in `target/ltp-baseline/` (not committed).

## What remains (full run 14, 468a6a67)

154 known failures and one hang (dirtyc0w_shmem). The larger groups, each needing a
feature rather than a fix:

- **fork14 (fixed after run 13): lazy reservations.** An anonymous
  mapping used to write a reservation entry for every 4 KiB page, and fork
  copied them all, so 16,384 one-GiB mappings made fork quadratic. Large
  private anonymous mappings (64 MiB or more, placed by the kernel,
  neither populated nor locked) are now recorded only as memory areas: a
  page with no table entry inside such an area reads as reserved with the
  area's protection (`lazy_linux_runtime_page` in `address_space.rs`), and
  it is made when first touched. Placement also avoids recorded areas.
  Smaller mappings still reserve each page; moving them to areas too is
  the roadmap's next memory step.
- **Shared-resource clones** (clone02, clone05, kcmp03 pass): a process
  clone may share its parent's memory, descriptor table, filesystem
  context and signal handlers (CLONE_VM, CLONE_FILES, CLONE_FS,
  CLONE_SIGHAND), take another parent (CLONE_PARENT), exit signal,
  thread pointer and tid words. Each process names what it shares by an
  id in the registry (`linux_process::SharedResource`; kcmp compares
  them). A CLONE_VM child maps its parent's pages, which are made the
  parent's own first so writes are seen both ways; mappings made after
  the clone are not shared. Shared runtime state lives in each sharer's
  record and is brought into the bank as a call starts and written back
  to every sharer as it ends (`pull/push_linux_shared_runtime_state`);
  the group holds one table's open files, released by the last to go,
  and exec unshares descriptors and handlers. A vfork parent waits until
  its child executes or exits (`linux_vfork_wait_live`). Still failing:
  clone301's CLONE_NEWPID case (no PID namespaces) and clone09 (no
  network namespaces or /proc/sys/net); clone08 and clone10 are skipped
  because musl's clone() refuses CLONE_THREAD, CLONE_SETTLS and
  CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID.
- **Privileged operations** now run in a domain set `privileged=true`
  (the LTP domain is): root there holds machine-level authority, so
  reboot resets the machine and syslog reads the machine's kernel log
  (`kernel_log.rs`; reboot01-02, syslog11-12, vhangup02 and
  delete_module02 pass). chroot gives a process its own root directory
  (inherited, kept across exec): absolute paths, `..` and absolute
  symlink targets resolve inside it, `/proc` is not visible there unless
  mounted, and getcwd shows paths from it or "(unreachable)" (chroot02-04
  and realpath01 pass). Process accounting writes Linux's version 2
  records (acct01-02 pass). ptrace has its core: PTRACE_TRACEME, ATTACH,
  SEIZE, CONT, KILL and DETACH, signal-delivery stops its tracer's wait
  sees, and tracees detached when their tracer exits (ptrace01, 03, 05,
  06, 07 pass); reading and writing a tracee's memory and registers,
  single-stepping and breakpoints are not implemented (ptrace08-10), and
  init cannot be traced (ptrace11). Still to implement: pivot_root. iopl and ioperm check their
  arguments but stay refused even there (ioperm02, iopl02 pass; ioperm01
  and iopl01 are skipped): raw I/O ports would reach around the drivers'
  isolation.
- **Writable and executable memory** is allowed in a domain set
  `write-execute=true` (the LTP domain is); each page is writable or
  executable at a time and flips on the access that needs the other
  (mincore02 passes).
- **io_uring and fanotify** (`kernel/src/linux_io_uring.rs`,
  `linux_fanotify.rs`): rings and groups of their own, permission events,
  identifier (FID) and pidfd reporting, evictable marks and filesystem
  errors (FAN_FS_ERROR from a damaged ext4 volume or an `abort`
  remount); io_uring04 (RDS sockets) and fanotify25 (kprobes) report
  TCONF.
- **perf events**: not offered (the tests report TCONF).
- **Keys** (`crates/keyrings`): user, logon, keyring, asymmetric (RSA
  X.509 and PKCS#8), dns_resolver and encrypted keys, KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE
  and KEYCTL_PKEY_QUERY. Tests that `modprobe` a key parser find it in
  the `/lib/modules/RELEASE/modules.builtin` that `tests/ltp/setup.sh`
  writes, as a Linux kernel package would install it.
- **Loop devices** (`kernel/src/linux_loop.rs`: /dev/loop-control,
  /dev/loopN backed by overlay files, /sys/block/loopN with its stat
  counters) and RAM disks (`linux_ramdisk.rs`, /dev/ramN) pass
  ioctl_loop01-07.
- **Block-device filesystems**: ext2, ext3 and ext4 (`crates/ext2`,
  mounted through `kernel/src/linux_blockfs.rs`) on a loop device or RAM
  disk, so the tests that format and mount a device (`.needs_device`,
  `.mount_device`, `.all_filesystems`) run, on ext2, ext3, ext4 and
  tmpfs. ext4 has what `mke2fs -t ext4` turns on: extents (fallocate's
  allocate, punch, zero, collapse and insert modes, SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE),
  64-bit descriptors, flex_bg, uninitialized groups and metadata_csum.
  The journal is not written (changes go to their places, as on ext2,
  and the journal stays empty); one that needs replaying is refused.
  swapon/swapoff (`kernel/src/linux_swap.rs`) take mkswap'd swap files
  on volumes and swap partitions (loop devices, RAM disks), with
  /proc/swaps; SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD punches a loop device's backing file.
  Disk quotas (quotactl, quotactl_fd: `crates/ext2/src/quota.rs`) are
  kept in vfsv0/vfsv1 quota files, either the ones quotacheck makes
  (mounted with usrquota/grpquota) or ext4's hidden quota inodes (the
  quota and project features); usage follows every allocation, chown and
  deletion, and enforced limits are EDQUOT (quotactl01, 04, 06, 08, 09;
  the others need xfs).
  The LTP tree carries e2fsprogs and the quota tools from the builder
  (mkfs.ext2/3/4, e2fsck, tune2fs, debugfs, chattr, e4crypt, quotacheck:
  `tools/ltp/container-build.sh`),
  which `tests/ltp/setup.sh` installs into the domain. xfs, btrfs, vfat,
  exfat and ntfs are not there (ENODEV), so LTP skips them. ioctl_loop05 runs through
  `/opt/ltp/disk-tmpdir.sh`, which gives it a TMPDIR on an ext2 volume of
  its own (the domain's /tmp is the overlay, device 0). The device tests
  still skipped in `syscalls.list` say what they lack.
- **Swap**: memory is paged out to the swap areas
  (`kernel/src/linux_swap.rs` hands out the slots,
  `cpu/linux_swapon.rs` does the I/O and reclaim). A charge past a
  cgroup's memory.max, or the machine short of frames, first drops
  MAP_DROPPABLE and unwritten MADV_FREE pages, then pages out private
  anonymous memory (mappings and the heap; not the stack, locked, huge,
  shared or copy-on-write pages), coldest first by the accessed bit, 32
  pages at a time, then drops the swap cache. A paged-out page is a
  non-present page-table entry holding its swap entry and protection; a
  fault reads it back, fork shares the slot (counted per slot, Linux's
  swap_map), munmap, exit, MADV_DONTNEED and MADV_FREE free it, and
  swapoff reads every page back first (ENOMEM if it cannot).
  MADV_PAGEOUT and process_madvise(MADV_PAGEOUT) page out at once,
  shared memory too (a shmem or memfd page only one mapping maps, whose
  node then notes the swap entry); MADV_WILLNEED reads pages into the
  swap cache (SwapCached). Swap is charged to the page's cgroup
  (memory.swap.current, .max, .events) and shown in VmSwap, smaps' Swap,
  SwapFree, sysinfo and /proc/swaps' Used column. The current process's
  own pages go only while one of its faults is resolved, or while the
  kernel brings in a range of its memory it is about to use (that range
  stays). The tests that need free swap rather than making their own
  (madvise06, madvise09, process_madvise01) run through
  `/opt/ltp/with-swap.sh MIB`, which turns a loop device over a sparse
  file on for the test; linox_swap01 (`tools/ltp/tests`, built with LTP)
  oversubscribes a memory cgroup from three processes with a swap file on
  ext4, forks while pages are out and turns swap off while they are.
  /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes reads 8192 and swappiness 60.
- **Page cache and tmpfs limits**: a volume's file data goes through a
  page cache (`linux_blockfs`, frames in overlay page-cache nodes) that
  reads and writes fill and `/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` empties. Its
  pages, and tmpfs, memfd and shared-memory pages, are charged to the
  memory cgroup of the process that brings them in (memory.stat file and
  shmem; the frame's charge records which), and a charge past memory.max
  drops clean page cache first, never below a cgroup's effective
  memory.min, nor below its memory.low until nothing else is left (a low
  event then), as Linux's mem_cgroup_calculate_protection works the
  protection out (memcontrol01-04; 03 and 04 are skipped in the list, as
  late in a full run their 50 MiB page-cache writes outlast the tests'
  10 s checkpoints, though they pass alone). RWF_NOWAIT reads
  only cached pages (preadv203) and shared mappings of ext2 files map the
  cached pages, written back at msync, fsync, sync and unmount. A tmpfs
  mounted with `size=`, `nr_blocks=` or `nr_inodes=`
  (`linux_tmpfs_quota.rs`) fills to ENOSPC instead of exhausting memory
  (fallocate06). Punching a hole in a tmpfs file frees its whole pages
  and their blocks (the file becomes paged, so SEEK_HOLE and st_blocks
  see the hole: fallocate04, fallocate05).
- **Memory details**: mmap, madvise, mremap, msync, mlock and mseal
  corner cases, `/proc/self/smaps`, `/proc/PID/pagemap`. A Linux
  process's first 4 GiB hold only the kernel's own 2 MiB regions (its
  image and the firmware's runtime services, `paging::linux_low_template`;
  under QEMU about 90 MiB near 2 GiB), so MAP_32BIT places around them
  (mmap24). MAP_FIXED still starts at 256 MiB, not mmap_min_addr: below
  it munmap, mprotect and madvise take the program-image paths. Shrinking
  a file turns its pages past the new end into SIGBUS pages only in the
  process that truncates it.
- **The main stack**: exec puts it at the top of the address space
  (ending at 0x7fff_ffff_f000, far above the mmap area), where it grows
  down to RLIMIT_STACK's soft limit as the limit is when it grows (8 MiB
  by default, as Linux's _STK_LIM; unlimited stops at 64 GiB), and not
  within the stack guard gap (256 pages) of a mapping below; past either,
  the fault is SIGSEGV (linox_stack01, process_madvise01's 1 MiB stack
  array). The domain's first process keeps its stack above its heap
  until it execs. stack_clash is skipped: it maps MAP_FIXED next to the
  stack and over every gap below it, and MAP_FIXED takes only 256 MiB to
  1 TiB.
- **musl, not the kernel**: tests that cannot pass with musl are skipped
  in `tests/ltp/syscalls.list` with the reason (fork() is the fork system
  call, readlink with size 0 gets a one-byte buffer, fchmod retries
  through /proc/self/fd, NGROUPS is 32, sched_getscheduler is ENOSYS).

## Baseline (2026-10-31)

Linox at `d1f41667` (no kernel change since), LTP 20260930,
`tests/ltp/syscalls.list`, QEMU/KVM with one vCPU and 6 GiB, domain
`alpine:3.22`:

| Run | Tests run | TPASS | TFAIL | TBROK | TCONF | TWARN | CRASH | HANG | SKIP | Boots | Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | 1362 | 41 | 39 | 1181 | 75 | 6 | 11 | 9 | 190 | 17 | 16 min |
| Diagnostic variant (`no-oom-protection`) | 1362 | 1047 | 39 | 127 | 76 | 6 | 53 | 14 | 190 | 64 | 53 min |

The 190 skips: 181 tests need a loop block device, 6 need kernel modules,
and 3 did not build under musl. Two baseline runs gave the same result for
every test. The variant is not fully repeatable: in an interrupted earlier
variant run `bind04` wedged the guest, here it passed, so state left by
earlier tests in the same boot matters.

One bug dominates the baseline: **1136 of the 1181 TBROKs are LTP's library
failing its own setup** because `/proc/PID/oom_score_adj` does not keep the
value written to it. Every new-API LTP test stops there. The diagnostic
variant (see below) skips that one check: then **1047 tests pass (77% of
those run)**, and the remaining failures are the real work list.

### Failure clusters

Counts are tests, from the baseline (B) and the variant (V); the logs are
`target/ltp/logs/NAME.log` (and `target/ltp-no-oom-protection/logs`).

1. **`oom_score_adj` does not stick** (B 1136). LTP writes -1000 to
   `/proc/<lib pid>/oom_score_adj`, reads 0 back and gives up. Linox must
   keep the value (-1000..1000, per process) or refuse the write (`EACCES`),
   which LTP tolerates. `getpid01`:
   ```text
   tst_tmpdir.c:308: TINFO: Using /tmp/ltp/LTP_getNAgHIC as tmpdir (ramfs filesystem)
   tst_memutils.c:176: TBROK: oom_score_adj = 0, but expect -1000.
   ```
2. **A fault or failed fork in one process takes the whole domain down**
   (all CRASH results: B 11, V 53). *Status:* a fault now kills only the
   faulting process (`643d714b`), and pages have a map count, so munmap,
   copy-on-write, exec and exit no longer free a page another process still
   maps (the cause of the "snapshot failed at stage 8" and "completion failed
   at stage 162" crashes). The memory/fork/wait slice runs without a crash. The kernel cannot complete or
   unwind the child ("runtime fork preparation failed at stage 13/11",
   "runtime child completion failed at stage 14/17/162", "live registry
   refresh snapshot failed at stage 8"), resumes the parent in the wrong
   context ("Linux resume FS mismatch", "scheduled process return failed"),
   the domain's init faults and the domain is marked failed. In four tests
   the runner (the test program's parent) exits with status 255 instead
   (`fork04`, `ptrace07`, `recvfrom01`, `rt_tgsigqueueinfo01`). Triggers:
   `abort()` in old-API tests (`getres[gu]id02/03*`: `SIGABRT` does not
   terminate, musl's `a_crash` executes `hlt` and takes #GP), tests that
   fork several children (`waitpid06`..`13`, `kill06/08/10`, `execve05`,
   `fork07`, `futex_wake03`, `semctl01`), and user page faults in tests
   (`chmod01`, `epoll_wait01`, `select04`, `sendfile07`, `shmat01`,
   `waitid05/06`, `madvise10/11`, `munmap01`). After such a crash the domain
   cannot be started again until reboot ("Linux process registry setup
   failed"). `waitpid06` (V):
   ```text
   linox: runtime fork preparation failed at stage 13
   linox: runtime child completion failed at stage 13
   linox: scheduled process return failed child/parent/resumed/dispatch: 3 1 0 0
   linox: Linux user fault vector/error/address/rip:14 6 18446744071616660459 4406038
   linox: Linux init execution failed; domain marked failed
   ```
3. ~~**Root cannot change credentials**~~ (B 15, V 38; fixed 2026-11-01):
   each process now has real, effective, saved and filesystem ids and
   supplementary groups (`crates/credentials`), files have owners, and opens,
   creates, removals, chmod, chown, utimes, access(2) and exec check them.
   Root may switch ids only in a domain set `user-switching=true`, the one
   flag that grants it (`linux_user::user_switching_allowed`); the LTP
   harness sets it. `setgroups03` still fails: LTP built for musl expects
   `setgroups(33, ...)` to fail because musl's `NGROUPS` is 32, while
   Linux (and Linox) allow 65536.
4. **A signal-killed child is reported as a normal exit with status 128+N**,
   and **a parent's `alarm` reaches its child** (V 27 at exactly 30 s; B
   `kill12`). `waitpid` gives `WIFEXITED` with 137 for `SIGKILL`, 139 for
   `SIGSEGV`; LTP prints "Child returned with 137/142". LTP's 30 s overall
   timeout is an `alarm` in the library's parent, yet the test child dies of
   `SIGALRM` (142): `alarm` is inherited across `fork` or delivered to the
   wrong process. `kill12` (B): `signal error: unexpected exit number
   returned when signal sent was 9, the status of the process is 35072`.
5. **Blocking calls are not interrupted by signals** (V 5, then the 30 s
   timeout of cluster 4): `msgrcv05/06`, `msgsnd05/06`, `semop03` get
   `EAGAIN` where `EINTR` is expected. `msgsnd05`: `TFAIL: msgsnd(24,
   0x44c040, 1024, 0) expected EINTR: EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK (11)`.
6. **`TST_CHECKPOINT` wake-ups between processes time out** (V 17):
   `tst_checkpoint_wake(0, 1, 10000) failed: ETIMEDOUT (110)` in `pause01/02`,
   `epoll_wait05/15`, `execve04`, `fcntl15`, `mincore04`, `pipe13`,
   `process_vm_readv02/03`, `tgkill01`. LTP's checkpoints are futexes in a
   `MAP_SHARED` file page; the waking parent never finds the waiting child
   (cross-process futex keys, or the child never reached the wait).
7. **Missing `/proc` files** (B 29, more in V): `/proc/sys/kernel/tainted`
   (19 tests with `.taint_check` stop before running), `/proc/mounts` and
   `/proc/self/mounts` (7-9), `/proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces` (7), and
   single ones (`kernel/pid_max`, `shmmax`, `sem`, `msgmni`, `printk`,
   `core_pattern`, `io_uring_disabled`, `fs/pipe-max-size`, `/proc/modules`).
   Without the harness's `KCONFIG_SKIP_CHECK=1` another 95 tests stop at
   "Cannot parse kernel .config"; Linox could publish `/proc/config.gz`.
   `bpf_prog04`:
   `tst_taint.c:43: TBROK: Failed to open FILE '/proc/sys/kernel/tainted'
   for reading: ENOENT (2)`.
8. **POSIX record locks are per process; no leases** (V 20, B 10 of them):
   `F_GETLK` does not see another process's lock and `F_SETLK` takes an
   already locked region (`fcntl11/15/17/19/20/21/22` and `_64`);
   `F_SETLEASE` and `F_GETOWN_EX` return `EINVAL` (`fcntl23/27/31/32`).
   `fcntl11`: `TFAIL: fcntl11.c:156: lock type is wrong should be F_RDLCK is
   F_UNLCK`.
9. **Hangs: a spinning process is never preempted for signals or timers**
   (B 9, V 14). Five to ten tests wedge the guest until the host watchdog
   reboots it (`sigrelse01`: 153 million `read` calls returning `EAGAIN`;
   `setsid01`, `rename14`, `sendmsg02`, `setitimer01`, `setrlimit06`,
   `times03`, `epoll_wait08`, `perf_event_open02`, `prot_hsymlinks`); the
   kernel only logs "Linux runtime exceeded sixty seconds". `pipeio_1/2/5/7`
   hit the runner's 60 s budget and `pipeio_3/4/6/8` warn "Timed out waiting
   for child processes to exit". Related: `sleep 2` in the domain returns at
   once.
10. **Socket errno mapping** (6): operations on a non-socket descriptor
    return `EBADF` instead of `ENOTSOCK` (`recv01`, `send01`, `sendto01`,
    `recvfrom01`, `listen01`); `MSG_ERRQUEUE` gives `EINVAL` instead of
    `EAGAIN`; `SIOCGIFCONF` gives `ENOTTY` (`sockioctl01`). `recv01`:
    `TFAIL: recv01.c:124: invalid socket ; returned -1 (expected -1), errno 9
    (expected 88)`.

Smaller ones: setting the clock is Policy-denied (`clock_settime01..04`,
`clock_adjtime01/02`, `settimeofday01`, `stime01`: `EPERM`), `mprotect` and
`mmap` `EINVAL` cases (`mprotect02/04`, `signal06`, `mmap03/18`),
`tst_get_bad_addr` failing (`clock_adjtime02`, `symlink03`), `msync02`
reading stale data, guarded-buffer corruption in `chmod01`, `renameat2`
flags (`EINVAL`), `removexattr` returning `ENODATA` for `ENOENT`,
`open(O_DIRECTORY)` succeeding on a FIFO (`fcntl07`: LTP's cleanup then
fails with `ENOTDIR`). The tests read the kernel's configuration from
`/proc/config.gz` (`kernel/src/arch/x86_64/cpu/kernel_config`, which lists
what Linox implements; `KCONFIG_SKIP_CHECK` is no longer set). The lease
tests (fcntl24-26, 32, 33) and lseek11 run with their TMPDIR on an ext2
volume (`disk-tmpdir.sh`), as on a Linux machine whose /tmp is on disk:
LTP skips them on tmpfs and ramfs. TCONF is mostly expected:

- **As on Linux 6.12 (x86_64, musl):** interfaces newer than 6.12:
  pre-content fanotify events (fanotify24, 6.14), `AT_HANDLE_CONNECTABLE`
  (name_to_handle_at03, 6.13), madvise12 (6.13). No `readdir` system call
  on x86_64 (readdir21); ptrace04 knows no x86_64 registers. ioprio_set01
  steps a priority of 0 down to -1 (a fresh process's ioprio is
  IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE, 0, as on Linux). kill13 needs a UBSAN kernel. musl
  has no `sethostid` (gethostid01), and the image no `<sys/acl.h>`
  (getxattr05, listxattr04). 32-bit-only syscalls; NUMA tests that need two
  nodes (Linox has one, node 0, as a one-node Linux machine does).
- **Filesystems Linox does not have:** xfs (getxattr04), btrfs (ioctl08),
  NFS (statx07, which also needs `exportfs`), RDS sockets (recvmsg03,
  io_uring04), fs-verity, XFS quotas, kTLS (setsockopt10), netfilter
  (setsockopt08), swap (madvise06, process_madvise01, swapon04), kprobe
  events (fanotify25), block integrity (ioctl_getlbmd01).
- **The test image:** no `parted` (ioctl09); musl's `struct statx` has no
  `stx_dio_*` fields (statx10, statx11: the kernel reports
  `STATX_DIOALIGN`).
- **Linox's limits:** sendfile09 wants 5 GiB free where the LTP domain has
  4 GiB; no TUN/TAP device (ioctl03).

`target/ltp-report.txt` lists every cluster with its tests;
`tests/ltp/report.py --variant no-oom-protection` does the same for the
variant.

## Running it

Requirements: Docker (the build runs in a pinned Alpine container), QEMU with
KVM, and OVMF.

```sh
make ltp            # tools/ltp/build.sh: build LTP into build/ltp (~5 min once; then a no-op)
make test-ltp OVMF_CODE=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.fd \
    OVMF_VARS=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS_4M.fd
```

`make test-ltp` builds Linox (`make build`) and runs `tests/qemu/ltp.sh`,
which builds and runs the Rust harness in `tests/ltp` (below). To keep a
running VM's `build/esp` untouched, build and boot a separate image:
`make test-ltp ESP_DIR=build/esp-ltp`. `TMPDIR` defaults to `target/tmp`.
The full list takes about 25 minutes on KVM today. Select tests with

```sh
tests/qemu/ltp.sh --tests "abort01 accept01"     # by name
tests/qemu/ltp.sh --filter '^(open|read)'        # by regular expression
tests/qemu/ltp.sh accept                         # libtest's filter: names containing "accept"
tests/qemu/ltp.sh -- --exact accept01 -q         # libtest's arguments, after --
LTP_FILTER='^mmap' make test-ltp                 # the same from make (LTP_ARGS for the rest)
```

`tests/qemu/ltp.sh --help` lists the other options (`--list FILE`,
`--variant`, `--esp-dir`, budgets, memory, the domain image, `--strict`,
`--update-baseline`); each sets one of the environment variables the
harness reads.

### The harness

`tests/ltp` is a standalone crate (its own workspace, like `userland/`).
Its test target `ltp` uses [libtest-mimic](https://crates.io/crates/libtest-mimic)
to make each entry of the run list one trial, named by its tag, so cargo
runs it and libtest's arguments select tests:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path tests/ltp/Cargo.toml --test ltp -- accept          # names containing accept
cargo test --manifest-path tests/ltp/Cargo.toml --test ltp -- --exact accept01
cargo test --manifest-path tests/ltp/Cargo.toml --test ltp -- --list          # list; boots nothing
cargo test --manifest-path tests/ltp/Cargo.toml --test ltp -- --ignored       # the tests the list skips
LTP_VARIANT=probe LINOX_ESP_DIR=build/esp-probe LTP_LIST=/path/probe.list \
    cargo test --manifest-path tests/ltp/Cargo.toml --test ltp -- -q
make ltp-check                                   # the harness's fmt, clippy and unit tests
```

The settings come from the environment (`tests/ltp/src/config.rs`):
`LTP_LIST`, `LTP_TESTS`, `LTP_FILTER`, `LTP_VARIANT`, `LINOX_ESP_DIR`,
`LTP_BUDGET`, `LTP_GRACE`, `LTP_BETWEEN_TESTS`, `LTP_SETUP_TIMEOUT`,
`LTP_MAX_BOOTS`, `LINOX_MEMORY`, `LTP_DOMAIN_MEMORY_MIB`, `LTP_IMAGE`,
`LTP_BASELINE`, `LTP_STRICT=1` and `LTP_UPDATE_BASELINE=1` (relative paths
are taken from the repository root; `ltp.sh` resolves them from where it
runs). `--strict` and `--update-baseline` also work as arguments of the
test binary. The harness applies libtest's selection before it boots, so
the guest runs only the selected tests. They all share one QEMU session,
which runs on a background thread in list order; the trials run one at a
time (`--test-threads` is forced to 1), each waiting for its result.
`ltp.sh` builds the test binary and runs it directly rather than through
`cargo test`, so a SIGTERM to its PID or a Ctrl-C reaches it: it stops
QEMU, writes the final results, prints the summary and exits 1.

Each test is one libtest line:

```text
test abort01      ... ignored (known failure: TFAIL)
test access01     ... ok
test add_key05    ... ignored (TCONF: ...)
test cachestat01  ... ignored (SKIP: auto: needs a loop block device (mkfs and mount))
test fork14       ... FAILED
```

| Result | Trial |
|---|---|
| `TPASS` | ok |
| `TCONF`, `SKIP` | ignored, with the first TCONF message or the list's reason |
| `TFAIL`, `TBROK`, `TWARN`, `HANG`, `CRASH` | ignored as `known failure: RESULT` if the baseline lists the test; otherwise failed, with the result, its detail and the last 40 lines of the test's log |
| `NOTRUN` | failed (not reached) |

On a terminal a status line shows what runs now and for how long (the boot
step, such as the first domain start pulling Alpine, or the current test),
the results so far and the elapsed time, e.g.
`[412/1362] running fork14 12s | pass 380 fail 20 broken 9 conf 3 | 6m41s`.
It follows libtest's open `test NAME ... ` line (or is a line of its own
when stdout is not the terminal), and messages such as a reboot print above
it. Without a terminal the boot steps print as `ltp:` lines instead.

### The baseline

`tests/ltp/baseline.txt` lists the tests known not to pass, one
`NAME RESULT` per line (TFAIL, TBROK, TWARN, HANG or CRASH; tests the list
skips and TCONFs are not in it). A listed test that fails again is ignored
as a known failure, whatever its result now; a failure of any other test is
a regression and fails the run, so a full run with no regressions exits 0
(failing trials or an incomplete run exit 101). A listed test that passes is
a pass, and the run ends by printing `newly passing: NAME...` (and
`no longer failing (now TCONF): NAME...`) so the baseline can be updated:
`tests/qemu/ltp.sh --update-baseline` (`LTP_UPDATE_BASELINE=1`) rewrites it
from the run (failing tests that ran get their new result, tests that
passed or were TCONF are dropped, tests that did not run keep their
entries). `--strict` (`LTP_STRICT=1`) ignores the baseline: every failure
fails the run. `LTP_BASELINE=FILE` uses another file, e.g. for a variant.

Outputs:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `target/ltp-results.txt` | summary counts, then `NAME RESULT SECONDS DETAIL` per test, in list order; rewritten after every test |
| `target/ltp-report.txt` | results by LTP source directory, failure symptoms, errnos, Linox kernel diagnostics, crashes and hangs |
| `target/ltp/logs/NAME.log` | the console output of each test, kernel diagnostics included |
| `target/ltp-serial.log` | the whole serial console of every boot |

The results file's detail says why, e.g.

```text
abort01 TBROK 0.02 exit=2
pipeio_1 HANG 60.04 guest-timeout 60s
getdents01 CRASH 0.42 domain down: linox: Linux init execution failed; domain marked failed
```

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TPASS` | exit status 0 |
| `TFAIL`, `TBROK`, `TWARN`, `TCONF` | LTP's exit status bits (2 TBROK, 1 TFAIL, 4 TWARN, 32 TCONF, in that precedence); also `TBROK` if the test was killed by a signal (`killed by signal N`, or an exit status of 128 or more, which is how Linox reports a signal death today), could not be executed (126, 127), or the runner lost its status |
| `HANG` | over its time budget: `guest-timeout` (the runner killed it), `ltp-timeout` (LTP's own timeout fired: "Test killed! (timeout?)"), or `host-watchdog` (the guest stopped reporting; QEMU was rebooted) |
| `CRASH` | the domain, the kernel or QEMU went down during the test; QEMU was rebooted |
| `SKIP` | marked skipped in the list, with the reason as detail |
| `NOTRUN` | not reached (the run was interrupted or gave up) |

## How it works

- `tools/ltp/build.sh` downloads a pinned LTP release (SHA-256 checked, cached
  in `build/ltp-cache`), and in an `alpine:3.22` container pinned by digest
  builds `lib`, `libs`, `testcases/lib` and every directory of
  `testcases/kernel/syscalls` (plus the few `runtest/syscalls` entries that
  live elsewhere: `dirtyc0w*`, `dirtypipe`, `msgstress01`, `pipeio`,
  `prot_hsymlinks`). Each directory builds on its own with `make -k`, so a
  test that does not build under musl is skipped, not patched
  (`build/ltp/build-failures.txt`: today `fmtmsg01`, `timer_create01`,
  `timer_create03`). It also builds the old API's shell commands
  (`tools/apicmds`: `tst_resm`, `tst_brkm`, `tst_exit`, ... in
  `testcases/bin`, which `ioctl02`'s `test_ioctl` calls) and copies the
  builder's shadow tools (`useradd`, `userdel`, `usermod`, `groupadd`,
  `groupdel`, `groupmod`, with `libbsd` and `libmd`) to `distro/shadow` in
  the tree; `tests/ltp/setup.sh` installs them into the domain, whose Alpine
  has only busybox's `adduser`, so `add_key05`, `prot_hsymlinks` and
  `setpriority01` add their users as on a distribution. `--variant harness`
  is a plain copy in `build/ltp-harness` for trying harness changes without
  touching `build/ltp`. The build tree stays in `target/ltp-build`, so reruns are
  incremental, and a rerun with nothing changed returns at once: stamps in
  `build/ltp` (`.tree-inputs`, `.runner-inputs`) hash the release, builder
  image, variant and `tools/ltp` scripts, and Docker starts only when one of
  them changed (only for the runner when just `ltp-runner.c` did; `--force`
  rebuilds anyway). Outputs: the stripped tree `build/ltp/ltp`, `ltp.tar.gz`, and
  `ltp.tar.xz` (21 MB instead of 226 MB: the static binaries share most of
  their code, which only xz's large window sees), which is what the domain
  downloads.
- Binaries are **static-pie** (`-static-pie -fPIE`), not fixed-address
  `-static`: Linox runs a file written at runtime only if it is position
  independent; its fixed-address (ET_EXEC) loader accepts only tiny programs
  (5 code pages, 8 pages in all).
- The harness's session (`tests/ltp/src/session.rs`) boots Linox with
  `tools/qemu/run.sh` (6 GiB, KVM, a fresh sparse volume in `target/ltp`),
  creates domain `ltp` from `alpine:3.22`, and serves the tree, the runner and
  the run list over HTTP on a free port (the guest reaches it at 10.0.2.2).
  In the domain's shell it fetches `tests/ltp/setup.sh`, which downloads and
  unpacks the tree into `/opt/ltp` (about 4 s) and execs the runner.
- The runner, `tools/ltp/ltp-runner.c` (a static-pie C program built with
  LTP), runs each test as `sh -c "exec COMMAND"` in its own process group with
  stdin on `/dev/null`, `TMPDIR=/tmp/ltp`, `LTPROOT=/opt/ltp`, and
  `LTP_RUNTIME_MUL=0.1` (race and stress tests loop for a tenth of their
  runtime). It brackets each test's output with `@@LTP BEGIN` and
  `@@LTP END INDEX TAG STATUS MILLISECONDS LEFTOVER` and enforces the test's
  budget **in the guest** with `alarm`: at the budget it kills the test's
  process group. Afterwards it kills whatever the test left running (found
  through `/proc`, reported as `leftover=N`) and empties `TMPDIR`.
- The session watches the console. If the kernel panics, the domain goes down
  (`domain marked failed`, `Linux init exited`), the runner exits, QEMU
  exits, or a test runs past its budget plus 30 s without an `END` (the guest
  is wedged), it records `CRASH` or `HANG` for the running test, kills QEMU
  by PID, boots again (about 10 s: the volume keeps the domain and the OCI
  cache), and continues with the next test. It always reboots rather than
  restarting the domain: after a crash the kernel cannot start the domain
  again ("Linux process registry setup failed"). It gives up after three
  boots in a row that run no test, or after 400 boots.

### Linox limitations the harness works around

These are findings in their own right:

- `execve` in a domain's init process fails with `ENOENT`, so the runner
  cannot replace the init shell (`exec`); it runs as its child.
- busybox `timeout` takes the whole domain down (its vfork-and-daemonize
  watcher; "Linux runtime cleanup failed"), and the next domain start then
  fails until reboot. The runner enforces budgets itself.
- `alarm` does not interrupt the runner while a test spins on the CPU (the
  kernel only logs "Linux runtime exceeded sixty seconds"), and a few tests
  wedge the guest entirely; the host watchdog covers both.
- Fixed-address static executables written at runtime are rejected
  (`ENOEXEC`, "Linux exec of runtime file rejected"), hence static-pie.

## The run list

`tests/ltp/syscalls.list` has one line per `runtest/syscalls` entry, in LTP's
order:

```text
# comment
TAG COMMAND [ARG...]                  run, default budget (60 s)
TAG COMMAND [ARG...]  # budget=N      run, allowing N seconds
!TAG COMMAND [ARG...] # REASON        skipped: recorded as SKIP with REASON
```

`tools/ltp/make-list.py` regenerates it from the build. Notes starting with
`auto:` are generated: a budget of LTP's timeout (30 s plus the test's
`.timeout`) plus a tenth of its `.runtime` plus 15 s, rounded up to 30 s,
when that exceeds 60 s; and skips for tests that did not build or that need
loadable kernel modules. Lines with any other note are curated by hand and
survive regeneration, so to skip a test permanently write
`!TAG COMMAND  # reason`.

Tests of Policy-denied operations (setting the clock, loading modules; see
[LINUX-COMPATIBILITY.md](LINUX-COMPATIBILITY.md)) are deliberately not
skipped yet. Changing credentials is decided: a domain's root may switch
users only with `user-switching=true`, which the LTP domain sets. Mark a
denied operation's tests with a curated reason, e.g.
`!clock_settime01 clock_settime01  # setting the clock is denied in domains`.

To investigate one test, run it alone (`--tests NAME`) and read
`target/ltp/logs/NAME.log`; the kernel's diagnostics are interleaved with
the test's output.

To add tests from another LTP runtest file, build its directories in
`tools/ltp/container-build.sh` and append its entries to a new list file;
`--list FILE` runs it.

To move to a new LTP release, change `ltp_version` and `ltp_sha256` in
`tools/ltp/build.sh`, run `make ltp`, then `tools/ltp/make-list.py`.

## Diagnostic variant: past the oom_score_adj blocker

`tools/ltp/build.sh --variant no-oom-protection` builds a second copy in
`build/ltp-no-oom-protection` whose LTP library skips the `oom_score_adj`
self-check that stops every new-API test today (two no-op functions linked
first; `tools/ltp/no-oom-protection.c`; LTP's sources are untouched). Run it
with `tests/qemu/ltp.sh --variant no-oom-protection`; its outputs carry the
suffix (`target/ltp-results-no-oom-protection.txt`, ...). It shows what fails
once that one bug is fixed; it is not the baseline.
