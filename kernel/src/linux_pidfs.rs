//! What a pidfd still tells about its process once a wait has reaped it:
//! PIDFD_GET_INFO with PIDFD_INFO_EXIT reports the reaped process's wait
//! status. Linux keeps it in the pid the pidfd holds; Linox keeps the
//! status of each domain's most recently reaped processes, by pid and
//! slot generation, with the PID namespace each lived in, so a pidfd
//! seen from another namespace stays refused.
