//! /etc on /mnt/x, /mnt/x/hosts opens the image's etc/hosts, whose path is

//! through a mount that leads elsewhere, that mount's point and target,
//! so the file shows as the point followed by its path below the target.
//! A file whose path is no longer below the target (renamed away) shows
//! by its own path again.
