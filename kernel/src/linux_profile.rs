//! A sampling profile of the Linux runtime, Linux's SysRq `l` in spirit:
//! writing `l` to `/proc/sysrq-trigger` samples where the runtime CPU is on
//! each of its next [`SAMPLES`] timer interrupts (the process, user or kernel
//! mode, and the instruction) and prints the counts once the samples are in.
//! A process that stalls everyone else shows up as the samples it takes:
//! its user code spinning, or a kernel loop to symbolize with
//! `tools/debug/symbolize.sh`. It also counts system calls by number, on
