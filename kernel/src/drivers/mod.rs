//! Device drivers for physical hardware, independent of the QEMU reference
//! devices that the main boot path is built around.
//!
//! These drivers poll instead of taking interrupts, use page-aligned static DMA
//! buffers, and reach registers through a `trusted::mmio::Mmio` window: in
//! hardware bring-up mode the firmware identity maps them (`Mmio::firmware`),
//! and in the main kernel the device window does (`Mmio::mapped`).
//!
//! The virtio drivers (`virtio`, `virtio_gpu`) run only in the main kernel:
//! they reach registers through the kernel's device window and take DMA
//! memory from the frame allocator, behind the handles in `device_memory`.
