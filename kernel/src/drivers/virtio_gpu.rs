//! virtio-gpu as the display, for the kernel console and /dev/fb0.
//!
//! A virtio-gpu has no framebuffer of its own: the guest draws into a 2D
//! resource's backing, which is ordinary guest memory, and tells the host
//! which rectangles to copy into the resource (`TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D`) and
//! show (`RESOURCE_FLUSH`). The driver makes one resource the size of the
//! mode the host prefers (`GET_DISPLAY_INFO`), backs it with physically
//! contiguous kernel frames, and points a scanout at it. The console and
//! /dev/fb0 then use that backing exactly as they use the firmware
//! framebuffer: the console draws into it, and a domain maps it.
//!
//! Bring-up follows the xHCI input driver. [`discover`] finds the device
//! before the kernel builds its page tables, so its registers join the
//! device window. [`prepare`] opens it while DMA translation is still off,
//! creates and backs the resource, and returns the DMA regions to admit;
//! the I/O MMU admits them together with the USB controllers', as standing
//! devices. [`activate`] then shows the resource and moves the console and
//! /dev/fb0 onto it. Without a virtio-gpu, or if any step fails, the
//! firmware framebuffer stays the display.
//!
//! Flushing: the host only sees what the guest flushes.
//!
//! - The console reports the rectangle it drew after each write, and the
//!   same goes for write(2) to /dev/fb0. Damage accumulates in one atomic
//!   word, and whoever holds the GPU transfers and flushes it. A caller
//!   waits (briefly) for a flush already in progress rather than leave its
//!   own damage behind, so the last line written is always shown.
//! - A domain that maps /dev/fb0 writes it without the kernel seeing, so
//!   while a domain owns the screen the 1 kHz Linux timer tick flushes the
//!   whole surface at [`REFRESH_HZ`]. The tick never waits: when a flush
//!   is still in progress it tries again on the next tick.
//!
//! The control queue carries many commands at once, each a descriptor
//! chain returned when the device is done with it, in whatever order: a
//! flush, a setup command the caller waits for, or a fenced 3D submission
//! that comes back only once the host has run it. The device is polled,
//! never interrupting. The GPU sits behind a latch that
//! is only ever tried, never waited on, because the console reaches it
//! from any context, interrupt handlers and code holding ranked locks
//! included: a caller that finds it held leaves its damage for the holder
//! or the next tick.
