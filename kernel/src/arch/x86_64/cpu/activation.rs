//! Kernel stacks for Linux process activations.
//!
//! Entering a Linux process starts an activation: the process runs in ring 3
//! and makes its system calls, until one of them returns to the kernel. Each
//! activation gets a kernel stack of its own instead of continuing below the
//! frames of whoever entered the process. A process that runs others from
//! inside a system call (today's nested scheduling) therefore only holds its
//! own frames on its stack, and the entering CPU's stack only holds the
//! runtime's. This is step 2 of docs/SCHEDULER.md; switching between parked
//! activations follows.
//!
//! Stacks live in the kernel stack window (`paging::KERNEL_STACK_WINDOW_BASE`),
//! one per 512 KiB slot: the stack's pages at the top of its slot and the
//! rest of the slot unmapped, so kernel work that overflows its stack faults
//! on a guard page (reported as a double fault) instead of overwriting the
//! memory below it. A finished activation's stack is kept for the next one,
//! as many as are live or [`SPARE_STACKS`]; past that (after a burst of
//! thousands of processes) its frames go back to the frame allocator, and
//! its slot is mapped again only once every other CPU has loaded CR3 since
//! (or sits halted idle, and reloads it before it runs anything), dropping
//! any translation it still held of the slot's pages; the CPU mapping it
//! drops its own.
//!
//! A kernel context parks on its stack by switching to another: the switch
//! saves the callee-saved registers and the stack pointer, loads another
//! context's, and returns into wherever that one switched away (or, for a
//! new context, into its function). This is how a blocked system call will
//! wait on its own stack while others run; `verify_stack_switching` proves
//! the mechanism at boot.
