//! Sockets and pipes of Linux processes: TCP, UDP and ICMP through smoltcp
//! over the domain's virtio network device, and local streams (pipes,
//! socketpairs, Unix sockets and TCP connections between the interface's
//! own addresses) whose bytes stay in the kernel.
//!
//! Every socket lives in one table that grows as sockets open, as Linux's
//! file table does; a socket's id is its index there, which descriptors
//! store, and a closed socket's entry is reused. The table, smoltcp's state
//! and the device sit behind one lock, ranked below the kernel heap so that
//! the table, queues and socket buffers can grow while it is held. Calls
//! that wait take the lock once per attempt, so others run in between.
//!
//! Files that are not sockets travel through SCM_RIGHTS as file rights,
//! queued with ids from `FILE_RIGHT_BASE` up, so that a queue of rights
//! holds sockets and files alike.
