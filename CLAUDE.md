# Linox working notes

## Direction

Linox is a new kernel written in Rust that runs unmodified Linux programs
through a Linux ABI personality. It is not a rewrite of Linux:

- **Linux is the specification and the reference design, not the source.**
  Match Linux's observable behaviour (syscall results, errno, signal and wait
  semantics, `/proc` and device interfaces) and borrow its proven designs, but
  write idiomatic Rust with ownership designed in. Never translate or copy
  Linux (GPL-2.0) code; Linox is Apache-2.0. Reading Linux sources and
  datasheets to understand behaviour or hardware is fine.
- **Keep what Linox does better than Linux:** memory safety in the kernel,
  isolation as a first-class design (domains with their own roots,
  capabilities and lifecycle), drivers and protocol services in separate
  ring-3 domains with IOMMU-confined DMA, and measured, signed boot inputs and
  verified OCI roots. Root in a domain may switch to other user ids only when
  the domain is set `user-switching=true`: one flag, checked in one place
  (`linux_user::user_switching_allowed`), so it is the single point to secure.
  Two more single-point flags, both off by default: `write-execute=true`
  lets programs map memory writable and executable (JITs), each page still
  flipping between the two (`linux_write_execute_allowed` in cpu/linux_memory_protection.rs), and
  `privileged=true` gives the domain's root machine-level authority
  (reboot resets the machine, syslog reads the machine's kernel log) but
  never raw I/O ports (`linux_user::domain_privileged`). The LTP domain
  sets all three.
- **Small trusted core.** Confine `unsafe` to a minimal layer (page tables,
  context switch, MMIO, DMA) with documented invariants; everything above it
  is safe Rust (the "framekernel" idea).
- **The userland should be Rust too.** Domains boot `image=builtin://rust`
  (linox-init, brush, uutils coreutils, the desktop in `userland/`); libc is
  still musl until a Rust libc (mustang/c-ward, relibc) is viable.

## Roadmap (in order)

1. ~~Merge upstream~~ (done 2026-10-31, fb3f793b: SMP, `cpu/` modules,
   lock ranks, runtime owner structs; and once more 2026-11-08, 67bba694:
   upstream's final standalone kernel, `bootable-kernel-final`). Upstream
   (gmkurtzer/ginux) ended the standalone kernel on 2026-11-04 and its
   `main` is now a different product, a userspace kernel that runs on a
   Linux host: never merge it. Linox continues the standalone kernel on
   its own, with no upstream remote. New globals go in the runtime owner
   structs and `docs/feedback-hardening/writable-globals.tsv`; new
   `unsafe` blocks also update `tools/architecture/check-kernel-unsafe.sh`.
2. **Per-thread kernel stacks and a preemptive per-CPU scheduler**
   (design and migration steps: `docs/SCHEDULER.md`). Done (steps 1-4,
   2026-11-09): every process's calls run on a guarded activation stack of
   its own and park there to wait; the boot CPU's scheduler loop
   (`run_linux_runtime_loop`) owns the run queue and runs every process,
   init included, round-robin, so none runs nested inside another's system
   call; forks run the parent first (a vfork parent waits for its child's
   exec or exit), and every process can be preempted by the timer. Step 5's
   wakeups are done too: a waiting call blocks on what it waits for
   (`linux_wait_queue`: futex, children, socket and pipe slots, state
   changes, ticks, its deadline, signals) and leaves the run queue until a
   waker makes it ready, instead of being resumed to look again; a process
   with nothing else ready goes on in place after a yield or preemption,
   its state left in the CPU's bank. Next: an activation per thread (the
   rest of step 5, planned in docs/SCHEDULER.md); then step 6, per-CPU
   loops with IPI wakeups and load balancing, and splitting
   `kernel_entry_lock`.
3. **A real task and memory model:** per-process memory-area tracking (VMAs),
   a shared page cache, and dynamically sized tables in place of the fixed
   arrays (32 threads per process, kept in per-thread arrays that the
   scheduler's task struct should replace). The socket table (which pipes
   share), the scheduler's thread table, each process's address-space
   lists and the per-process-slot tables grow on demand: a domain holds
   up to `linux_process::PROCESS_LIMIT` (4096) processes (u16 slots, a
   pid index, signal queues, records and kernel stacks allocated as slots
   are first used; records of slots above 256 are freed with their
   process). Waits block until woken (`Process::block`, docs/SCHEDULER.md
   "Wait queues"); a multithreaded process blocks as a whole until its
   threads get activations of their own. Pages have a map count in the frame allocator
   (`memory::share_frames`): every address space that maps another's frame
   takes a count, and releasing drops one. Anonymous MAP_SHARED memory is
   an unnamed overlay shmem node, freed with its last mapping. Move large
   structures off the kernel stack. Memory areas: `crates/memory-areas`
   (host-tested, safe) holds a process's areas; `kernel/src/linux_areas.rs`
   keeps one set per process from mmap, munmap, mprotect, mremap and exec's
   segments (copied at fork, dropped at exec and exit) and `/proc/PID/maps`
   names files from it. The page tables are still the authority; next:
   record the stack and heap, then let fault handling and placement use
   the areas instead of page-table bits.
4. **Compatibility driven by the Linux Test Project (LTP)** rather than by
   finding bugs one program at a time: `just test-ltp` (docs/LTP.md has the
   baseline and failure clusters).
5. **Drivers:** virtio in VMs; Rust drivers for the hardware we target (this
   PC: Ryzen 7600X, AMD-Vi, NVMe, AMD xHCI, RTL8125, MT7922 Wi-Fi, Radeon
   RX 6800) — ultimately a GPU driver for Vulkan; software Vulkan meanwhile.
6. Run [cadrs](https://github.com/rvdende/cadrs) (Bevy/wgpu CAD) built and
   running inside the Linox desktop.

## Build, run, test

- `just` lists recipes; `just desktop` builds, boots Linox in a QEMU window
  with USB keyboard and tablet, and starts the Wayland desktop on the all-Rust
  userland. `make help` lists all targets.
- QEMU tests need `OVMF_CODE=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.fd
  OVMF_VARS=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS_4M.fd`; the shared `/tmp` is often full,
  so set `TMPDIR` to a private directory (not for `test-hardware-profile`,
  whose monitor socket path must stay under 108 bytes).
- `make check` needs ripgrep (`rg`) for the architecture checks; it is not
  installed system-wide, so put VS Code's copy on PATH:
  `PATH=/usr/share/code/resources/app/node_modules.asar.unpacked/@vscode/ripgrep-universal/bin/linux-x64:$PATH`.
- Quick gate before committing: `make test-quick` (about 2 minutes: check,
  the all-Rust userland, the 4-CPU multicore test). The full suites and LTP
  take half an hour; run them for wide changes, not every commit.
- Key suites: `make check`, `make userland-check`, `make test-alpine`,
  `tests/qemu/rust-workloads.sh` (cargo builds serde inside Linox),
  `make test-rust-userland`, `make test-desktop`,
  `make test-desktop-virtio-gpu`, `make test-boot-media`,
  `make test-hardware-profile`.
- `tools/qemu/run.sh` boots whatever is in the ESP directory and does not
  build. `make build ESP_DIR=dir` with `LINOX_ESP_DIR=dir` keeps a separate
  image so a running VM's `build/esp` is not rewritten under it.
- run.sh switches: `LINOX_QEMU_MONITOR=sock` (HMP monitor: `screendump`,
  `sendkey`, `info registers`), `LINOX_QEMU_DISPLAY=gtk`,
  `LINOX_QEMU_USB_INPUT=1`, `LINOX_QEMU_GPU=virtio` (virtio-gpu, no VGA;
  `virtio-vga` keeps a VGA framebuffer for the firmware; `venus` adds 3D,
  Vulkan on the host GPU through Mesa's Venus) with
  `LINOX_QEMU_GPU_SIZE=WxH` (docs/GRAPHICS.md), `LINOX_QEMU_LOG=file` (pauses instead of exiting
  on a guest reset), `LINOX_QEMU_LOG_INTERRUPTS=1` with `QEMU_ACCEL=tcg`
  (logs every exception: finds triple faults).

## Debugging kernel crashes

A fatal exception prints vector, error, all registers, CR0/2/3/4, the kernel
image base and the kernel addresses on the stack, then `LINOX_KERNEL_PANIC`.
The image base is also printed at boot. Symbolize with
`tools/debug/symbolize.sh IMAGE_BASE ADDRESS...` (same sources as the run).
A CR2 just below RSP is a kernel stack overflow. If the machine resets with no
report, rerun under `QEMU_ACCEL=tcg LINOX_QEMU_LOG=... LINOX_QEMU_LOG_INTERRUPTS=1`.

For a hang or a slow domain, `echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger` lists every
task's threads (state, wait kind and key, saved registers), `echo u` each
CPU's user/kernel/idle/lock-wait time, the process banks in use, the
threads run on other CPUs and each live bank's thread table as the bank
holds it (the saved record of a process whose threads run elsewhere is
stale; docs/SCHEDULER.md), and `echo l`
profiles the runtime CPU for 1000 ticks (system calls, lock ranks, DRM
ioctls, timed spans in `kernel/src/linux_profile.rs`). Tick samples miss
kernel work done with interrupts off; sample CPU 0 from the host instead
(monitor `info registers`, symbolized as above). A domain that has run
sixty seconds writes one stall diagnostic to the kernel log (from the
timer, or the runtime loop when CPU 0 only halts): the newest entries of
the futex trace ring (`linux_trace_futex` in cpu/linux_diagnostics.rs: per CPU, who waited
at the thread or process level, who woke, with addresses and results),
the live banks, and the task states. That trace found a thread exit
whose tid-word wake never reached a joiner parked at the process level.

To see which system call a Linux program trips on, run it with
`LINOX_STRACE=1` in its environment: that process and every process it
starts log each call to the kernel log as `linox: strace PID/TID
NUMBER(args, "path") = result` (errors as `-errno`;
`kernel/src/linux_strace.rs`). Domains have no ptrace and images seldom
ship strace.

## Conventions

- Commit and push straight to `main` of origin (github.com/rvdende/linox);
  commit messages end with the `Co-Authored-By` line. Run the affected suites
  first and say in the message what still fails.
- `boot/efi/src/generated_boot.rs` is generated by `make manifest`/`make build`;
  commit it with controller and service changes, never edit it by hand.
- Clippy runs with `-D warnings` and unused code fails the build.
- Test and debug scripts poll for the event they need (a serial line, the
  monitor reporting `paused`) and stop at once; no fixed sleeps or
  `timeout`-killed waits. Run long suites in the background.
- Kill only your own QEMU by PID (`LINOX_QEMU_PID_FILE`); never
  `pkill -f` a pattern that also appears in your own command line.
- Never write to the host's NVMe except a partition with the Linox type GUID
  `80769f29-5413-45a3-abab-5b44b6125922`.
