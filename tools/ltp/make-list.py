"""Generates tests/ltp/syscalls.list from LTP's runtest/syscalls.

    tools/ltp/make-list.py [LIST]

Run after tools/ltp/build.sh (it reads build/ltp and the LTP sources in
target/ltp-build). Every runtest/syscalls entry becomes one line, in LTP's
order. Generated notes start with "auto:": tests whose binary did not build
or that need kernel modules (SKIP_RULES) are marked skipped,
and tests whose LTP timeout or runtime exceed the harness's default budget
get a larger budget. Lines with any other note are
curated by hand and are kept unchanged when the list is regenerated.
