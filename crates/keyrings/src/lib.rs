#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! The kernel's key retention service as Linux defines it for add_key(2),
//! request_key(2) and keyctl(2): keys with a type, description, payload,
//! owner and permission mask; keyrings that link them; the thread, process,
//! session, user and user-session keyrings a caller reaches through the
//! special key ids; possession; and the per-user quotas.
//!
//! One [`Keyrings`] holds every key of a domain. The kernel copies the
//! arguments in from user memory, describes the calling thread with a
//! [`Caller`], passes its clock where expiry matters, maps an [`Error`] to
//! its errno and copies an [`Output`] back by that output's rule. It also
//! reports fork, thread creation, exec and exit, because the special
//! keyrings belong to threads, processes and users.
//!
//! Every keyring link and every anchor (a thread's thread and session
//! keyring, a process's process keyring, a user's user and user-session
//! keyring) holds a reference to a key, and a key is dropped as soon as
//! nothing refers to it, with the links it held. Revoked and expired keys
//! therefore stay until they are unlinked; there is no delayed collector.
//!
//! The types are "user", "logon", "keyring", "asymmetric" (RSA keys
//! from X.509 certificates and PKCS#8 private keys), "dns_resolver" and
//! "encrypted"; "big_key" and "trusted" do not exist. There are no
//! upcalls: when request_key(2) is given callout data and finds nothing, it
//! leaves a negatively instantiated key behind and fails with ENOKEY, as
//! Linux does when /sbin/request-key cannot instantiate the key. Without
//! upcalls there are no authorization keys, so KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE,
//! KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE_IOV, KEYCTL_NEGATE and KEYCTL_REJECT are EPERM for
//! the kernel to return, and KEYCTL_ASSUME_AUTHORITY has nothing to assume.
//! KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE and KEYCTL_PKEY_QUERY are here; persistent keyrings,
//! security labels (KEYCTL_GET_SECURITY reports an empty one), the other
//! public-key operations and notifications are not modelled, and their
//! keyctl operations are EOPNOTSUPP.
//!
//! This is pure bookkeeping, so it can be tested on the host.
